To Do
============
- Add routine to integrate over removed mass matrix portion
- Add routine to cut volume integral from residual
- Add code to not compute fluxes across outside of boundary triangle
   - skip this for now?
- Handle all of the overset stuff
   - find mesh boundary edges 
   - handle fluxes on mesh boundary edges

Done
=========
- wrote routine to get rst coords of cut cell quads in orig cell coord syst
- Added gauss pts for quad

Data Structures that I need from pundit
==================================
- Total number of cut regions (could be more than 1 for cells containing a cut boundary corner?)
- map connecting IDs of the cut regions and the original cells being cut
- vertices of the polygon to be cut (does ordering matter?)
- q values from other mesh at new cut face
- array of cut region element types
