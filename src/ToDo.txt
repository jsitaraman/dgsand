To Do
============
- getting fluxes from other mesh -- maybe get this from inflow bc for now

Done but not tested
=========
- Add routine to cut volume integral from residual
- Add routine to cut face integrals from residual
- Add routine to integrate over removed mass matrix portion

Data Structures that I need from pundit
==================================
- Total number of cut regions (could be more than 1 for cells containing a cut boundary corner?)
- map connecting IDs of the cut regions and the original cells being cut
- vertices of the polygon to be cut (does ordering matter?)
- q values from other mesh at new cut face
(- array of cut region element types)
