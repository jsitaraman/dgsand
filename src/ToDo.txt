To Do
============
- blanking cells 
- defining overlap
- getting fluxes from other mesh -- maybe get this from inflow bc for now

Done but not tested
=========
- copies and shrunk the grid
- Add routine to cut volume integral from residual
- Add routine to cut face integrals from residual
- put all cut stuff in if(cut) loop
- Add routine to integrate over removed mass matrix portion
- wrote routine to get rst coords of cut cell quads in orig cell coord syst
- Added gauss pts for quad

Data Structures that I need from pundit
==================================
- Total number of cut regions (could be more than 1 for cells containing a cut boundary corner?)
- map connecting IDs of the cut regions and the original cells being cut
- vertices of the polygon to be cut (does ordering matter?)
- q values from other mesh at new cut face
- array of cut region element types
