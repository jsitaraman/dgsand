To Do
============
- Add routine to integrate over removed mass matrix portion
   - need to create new array of cut mass matrices only
   - currently only storing 1 mass matrix since it's the same for all elements
- Add routine to cut volume integral from residual
   - Do this after or during resid calc?
- Add Routine to handle fluxes on cut boundary
   - Do this after or during 
- Add routine to get q values and fluxes across boundary? 
   - Need this for baseline and conservative overset
- Add code to not compute fluxes across outside of boundary triangle
- Add routine to go between local coords in one element to another
   - Use to find quad pt locations in sub element
- Add in quadrature rules for quads 

Data Structures that I need
==================================
- array containing information on cut cells
- map between global ID's of cut cells and ID in cut cells-only array
- vertices of the polygon to be cut (ordering matters?)
- q values at new nodes of the cut volume (basically treated as an entirely new element)
- q values from other mesh at faces
