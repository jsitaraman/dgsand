This directory contains the source and
examples for a 2-D unstructured grid generator code.

This program was concieved 
by Jayanarayanan Sitaraman in 1996 as part of a 
undergraduate CFD class in Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.

There have been minor I/O modifications over the last 12 years,
but the core algorithm is untouched.

To Build:
=========
cd src;make
this should build executables make_domain and ugrid and copy it to
bin directory.

To execute: 
========== 
Domain boundary information can be provided in
file called "domain" which is read by "make_domain" and processed to
produce "nodes". The file "nodes" is the input file for "ugrid" which
produces a tecplot visualization file "triangles.dat". You can make your
flow solver compatible with "triangles.dat" or write a i/o filter as
desired. The ugrid program also produces the cell connectivity (i.e
neighbor information file). This is commented out now, but you can
revive it by appopriately editing the source.

Summary:

domain -> make_domain -> nodes
nodes -> ugrid -> triangles.dat

example:

cd example/flapslat
../../bin/make_domain
../../bin/ugrid
tecplot triangles.dat
